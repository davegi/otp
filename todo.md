# lesson summaries

## 10/20

- feeling better about job vs. career
- discussed LinkedIn (LI) style (too informal?) and migrating your resumeâ€™s *About Me* section to an *Objectives* section
- decided to stick with â€“ and I wonâ€™t tempt you with other projects ðŸ˜Ž â€“ `OTP` as itâ€™s already a known quantity, and is written to be net-centric (client/server â€“ C/S)  
  - as an aside, future projects â€“ like `Huffman` â€“ can be architected to be C/S as well
- did a deep-ish dive into :
  - [getopt(3): Parse options - Linux man page](https://linux.die.net/man/3/getopt)

### next

- [ ] complete dev. env. setup
- github/replit/gitpod
- VS Code, consider these extensions (they don't work in any of the browser envs.):
  - [Kanbn Extension for Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gordonlarrigan.vscode-kanbn)
- [ ] review otherâ€™s LI style to determine whatâ€™s next
- [ ] resume *v.Next*
- [ ] recreate `OTP` repl (missing `makefile`) as itâ€™s early and thereâ€™s very little to migrate
  - When complete, push all updates to repo
- [ ] design all three command lines
- [ ] implement `keygen`
